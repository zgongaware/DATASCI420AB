# Predicting the NFL Draft
Course Project for DATASCI 420 AB

**Description**

Around 16,000 college football players graduate from college or become eligible for the NFL draft each year; but
only only 253 of them will be drafted - around 1.6%.  What are the most predictive features of a given player to
determine if they will be selected?  Of those selected, can we predict what round they will go in?
